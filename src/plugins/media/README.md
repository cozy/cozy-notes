❔ The current fork of this plugin initially comes from [here](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-mirror/src/cd7cf8a57b0c4239085722d070f0086871b6fe05/editor/editor-core/) as **v134.0.1**.

If you want to check the source code please use the following commands:
* `git clone https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-mirror.git` (if not done already)
* `cd atlassian-frontend-mirror/plugins/media`
* `git checkout cd7cf8a57b0c4239085722d070f0086871b6fe05`

❗ Do not attempt to update it with the latest version of `media-plugin` from `editor-core` as it would render it inoperable in the current `cozy-notes` ecosystem.
